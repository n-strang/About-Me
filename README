Hello! My name is Nathan Strang but you can call me Nate.
I am 21 Years old, Currently going for my bachelors in computer science at UIC.

Ever since I found scratch.mit.edu in middle school, ive been obsessed with the idea of programming.
This passion for programming quickly took over my free time, as I remember having a computer science class at least once per year in highschool.
I have bounced from Swift, Java, Python, to C++ and have enjoyed them all! 

After years of learning multiple languages, I feel that my skillset best shines in C++, and I am excited to carry that with me as I progress through college.
I am looking to further my experience in software development outside of school, bringing my abilities with me to a chicago-based company

Specialties: in C, C++, and Swift
Academics: Data Structures, Algorithms, Machine Organization, Object Oriented Programming
